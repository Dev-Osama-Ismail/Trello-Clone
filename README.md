# Trello Clone üìù

Trello Clone is a task management application built with **React (Vite), Zustand, TailwindCSS, ShadCN-UI, and DnD-Kit**. It allows users to **create, manage, and organize boards, columns, 
and cards**, featuring **drag-and-drop** functionality, **real-time synchronization across multiple tabs** using **BroadcastChannel API and LocalStorage**, **undo/redo actions**, 
and **offline support**. The UI is fully responsive, styled with TailwindCSS and ShadCN-UI, and animations are powered by Framer Motion for smooth transitions.
